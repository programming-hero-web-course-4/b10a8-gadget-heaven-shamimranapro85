## React Fundamentals Used

This project leverages several key React fundamentals, including:

1. **Components**: The application is structured using reusable components.
2. **JSX**: All views are built using JSX syntax, allowing HTML-like structure within JavaScript.
3. **Props**: Data is passed to components via props to ensure modularity.
4. **State Management**: Local component states are managed to handle dynamic data changes.
5. **Hooks**: React hooks ( `useState`, `useEffect`) are used for managing state.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Data Display**: Data updates dynamically across the application, providing a responsive experience.
2. **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across devices.
3. **Purchasing many products**: Includes features such as rating stars, price, and interactive Details.
